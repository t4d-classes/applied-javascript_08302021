# Exercise 9

- Fully implement save car and cancel car buttons. Be sure to perform your save operation with immutable programming techniques. You should not mutate any objects when saving. When the cancel button is clicked, revert the changes back to the original.

Hint: To do the save, you can copy the array, next replace the item in the copy, then save the new array. A function such as findIndex can be used to find the index of an item.

- If one of the table rows is being edited, the edit row should change to a view row after, a car is added, or a car is deleted, or a car is saved. For the add or delete operations, the changes for the car being edited should not be saved.

- Ensure it works!
